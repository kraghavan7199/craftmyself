Tailoring your approach ensures both safety and continued progress, whether you're a teen building a foundation or a master athlete preserving strength.</p>

                    <li><strong class="text-white">Avoid 1RM Testing:</strong> Use higher rep ranges (5-12) to build muscle and skill without the risks of maximal loads on a developing skeleton.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Fuel for Growth:</strong> Caloric needs are high. Ensure adequate protein and overall energy intake to support both training and natural growth.</li>

                    <li><strong class="text-white">Prioritize Recovery:</strong> Recovery capacity diminishes with age. You may need more rest days, longer warm-ups, and more proactive deloads.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Increase Protein:</strong> Research suggests older adults may need more protein (~1.2-1.6 g/kg) to stimulate muscle protein synthesis effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Manage Volume:</strong> You can and should train hard, but you may not be able to tolerate the same weekly volume as a 20-year-old. Quality over quantity.</li>
